- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarBakas
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end programming and finding new exciting things to make
- 🌱 I’m currently learning php (soon here will be a few more names, but I am just starting)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate right now, unless it is some learning group (could be fun to!)
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail: marat31bv@gmail.com
